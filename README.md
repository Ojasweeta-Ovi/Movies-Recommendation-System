# Movies-Recommendation-System
Welcome to the Movies Recommendation System repository! This project was developed from May 2023 to June 2023 and aimed to create a personalized movie recommendation system based on user preferences and content similarity analysis. The system utilizes data collection, preprocessing techniques, TF-IDF feature vectorization, and cosine similarity calculations to provide tailored movie suggestions.

Features

Data Collection: The system collects movie data from various sources to build a comprehensive movie database.
Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations.
TF-IDF Feature Vectorization: Textual features from movie descriptions are extracted and converted into numerical representations using the TF-IDF technique.
Cosine Similarity: The system calculates the cosine similarity between movies based on their TF-IDF vectors to measure their content similarity.
Personalized Recommendations: By leveraging user preferences and content similarity analysis, the system generates personalized movie recommendations for users.
